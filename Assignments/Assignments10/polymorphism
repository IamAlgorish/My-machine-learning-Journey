Polymorophism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) that allows objects of different classes
to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It provides a way to perform a sigle action in different forms.
Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

### Method  overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already
defined in its parent class.
