### Understand Exceptions
Exception handling in Python allows you to handle errors gracefully and take corrective
actions without stopping the program's execution. This lesson will cover the basics of exceptions,
including how to use except, else, and finally blocks.

### What are Exceptions?
Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program. They occur when an error is 
encountered during program execution. common exception include:
* ZeroDivisionError: Dividing by zero.
* FileNotFoundError: File not found.
* ValueError: Invalid value.

##Exception try, except block 
====================================================
try:
   a = b
except:
    print("The variable has not been assigned")
====================================================
without this the error shows by it 
in a = b
cell In[4], line 1
----> 1 a = b
NameError: name 'b' is not defined
===================================================
other way to handle this 
as the error we can see is name error 
so make it expect name as NameError and make it alias
===================================================
try: 
    a = b
except NameError as ex:
    print(ex)
---------------------------------------------------
### ZeroDivsionError
try:
   result = 1/0
except ZeroDivisionError as ex:
      print(ex)
      print("please enter the denominator greater than 0")
===================================================
Try ,Except, Else Block
===================================================
try:
    num = int(input("Enter the num"))
    result = 10/num
except ZeroDivisionError
        print("You can't divide it by zero")
except ValueError:
        print("That's not a valid number!")
except Exception as ex:
        print(ex)
else:
     print(f"The result is {result}"
finally:
     print("Execution Complete")
---------------------------------------------------
else part is executed only if there is no error
finally, block always got executed
---------------------------------------------------

### FileNotFoundError
try:
    File = open('example.txt','r'):
           content = File.read()
           a = b
           print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
       print("File not found")
except Exception as ex:
       print(ex)
finally:
      if 'File' in locals() or not File.closed():
          File.close()
          print('file close')
