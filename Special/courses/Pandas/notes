Creating data
There are two core objects in pandas: the DataFrame and the Series.

DataFrame
A DataFrame is a table. It contains an array of individual entries, each of which has a certain value. Each entry corresponds to a row (or record) and a column.

For example, consider the following simple DataFrame:

pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131, 2]})
  Yes	No
0	50	131
1	21	2

==========================
In this example, the "0, No" entry has the value of 131. The "0, Yes" entry has a value of 50, and so on.
