When you multiple an integer or float by a boolean with value True, it just returns that same integer or float (and is equivalent to multiplying by 1). 
If you multiply an integer or float by a boolean with value False, it always returns 0. This is true for both positive and negative numbers.
If you multiply a string by a boolean with value True, it just returns that same string. And if you multiply a string by a boolean with value False,
it returns an empty string (or a string with length zero).
