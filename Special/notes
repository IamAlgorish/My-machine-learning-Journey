When you multiple an integer or float by a boolean with value True, it just returns that same integer or float (and is equivalent to multiplying by 1). 
If you multiply an integer or float by a boolean with value False, it always returns 0. This is true for both positive and negative numbers.
If you multiply a string by a boolean with value True, it just returns that same string. And if you multiply a string by a boolean with value False,
it returns an empty string (or a string with length zero).


##List
Slicing
You can also pull a segment of a list (for instance, the first three entries or the last two entries). 
This is called slicing. For instance:
to pull the first x entries, you use [:x], and
to pull the last y entries, you use [-y:].

flowers_list = ["pink primrose", "hard-leaved pocket orchid", "canterbury bells", "sweet pea", 
"english marigold", "tiger lily", "moon orchid", "bird of paradise", "monkshood", "globe thistle"]

print("First three entries:", flowers_list[:3])
print("Final two entries:", flowers_list[-2:])
O/p
First three entries: ['pink primrose', 'hard-leaved pocket orchid', 'canterbury bells']
Final two entries: ['monkshood', 'globe thistle']
flowers_list.remove("globe thistle")

dding itemsÂ¶
Add an item to a list with .append(), and put the item you would like to add in parentheses.

flowers_list.append("snapdragon")
print(flowers_list)

=======================
hardcover_sales = [139, 128, 172, 139, 191, 168, 170]

You can also get the minimum with min() and the maximum with max().

print("Minimum:", min(hardcover_sales))
print("Maximum:", max(hardcover_sales))
====================================================
To add every item in the list, use sum().

print("Total books sold in one week:", sum(hardcover_sales))

We can also do similar calculations with slices of the list. In the next code cell, 
we take the sum from the first five days (sum(hardcover_sales[:5])), and then divide by five to get the average number of books sold in the first five days.

print("Average books sold in first five days:", sum(hardcover_sales[:5])/5)

========================================================
You can actually use Python to quickly turn this string into a list with .split().
In the parentheses, we need to provide the character should be used to mark the end of one list item and the beginning of another,
and enclose it in quotation marks. In this case, that character is a comma.
================================
flowers = "pink primrose,hard-leaved pocket orchid,canterbury bells,sweet pea,english marigold,tiger lily,moon orchid,bird of paradise,monkshood,globe thistle"
================================
 print(flowers.split(","))
